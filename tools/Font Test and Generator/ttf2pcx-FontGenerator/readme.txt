   TTF -> PCX CONVERTER, version 2.2, April 2002

   This little win95 utility converts TrueType fonts into PCX files that can 
   be imported into the Allegro grabber program. Select a font, click on 
   export, type a filename, and don't blame me if it doesn't work, because I 
   wrote this in an afternoon and I haven't tested it properly :-)

   New in version 2.2: Fixed to work under Windows XP.

   New in version 2.1: changed ANSI_CHARSET font request to DEFAULT_CHARSET, 
   which should make Unicode grabbing work better.

   New in version 2.0: support for grabbing Unicode font data (any character 
   range from 1 up to 0xFFFF, pending you having a suitable TTF installed on 
   your machine). Also puts a more sensible palette in the output file.

   This update is for win32 only, because I don't have any way to update the 
   16 bit version with the new code (lack of a suitable compiler).

   As well as normal monochrome data the program can output antialiased 
   fonts, which are generated by rendering the TrueType characters at eight 
   times the requested size and then scaling down (an 8x8 supersampling grid 
   provides 64 intensity levels). Fonts in this format can be drawn in 
   Allegro by passing -1 as the color to textout(), but this will obviously 
   only work if you have a suitable gradient in your palette.

   This program is freeware. Use it or abuse it in any way you want. If you 
   want to recompile it you'll need a copy of Visual C++ version 6. It will 
   probably build ok with versions right back to whenever, but the project 
   file probably won't be readable by anything other than VC6. The code is a 
   total mess - please don't look too closely at it :-)
